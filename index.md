## The Universe, Probability, and Game Theory - Combined!

How does probability affect games of chance?  How do game creators combine skill and chance to make great games?  How do you make games fair?

Also, how do astronomers study our solar system?  What are asteroids, and how likely is it that one of them will hit us?  What is the likelihood that there is life on other worlds?  If so, will it ever attack us?  What would that be like?

If you have ever wondered about any of these questions, this course is for you.  Through a series of experiments, we will investigate games of chance and skill and increase our understanding of probability and why it matters in gaming.  We will explore our Solar System and beyond and apply our knowledge of probability to tackle the questions of how at risk we on planet Earth are from space invaders, both asteroid and alien.

This is a project-based, self-directed course, which means you can choose the projects that are meaningful to you and leave the rest.  For each project, we will give you readings, videos, and experiments to explore the topic, provide you with some project ideas to get you started (while encouraging you to spin our projects to fit your own passions), and give you a community of peers with whom to discuss topics and share your work.
