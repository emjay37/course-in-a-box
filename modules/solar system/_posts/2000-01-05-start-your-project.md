## What will you create?

Now that you have explored the solar system and learned how to scale large numbers down to reasonable ones, what will you do with that knowledge?  Will you build a traditional scale model, or create a more abstract work of art?  Will you create a book, video, or interactive simulation?  What inspires you?  What will you share with others?

Feel free to post project ideas and share incomplete work in order to get help or feedback, and when your project feels finished to you, we would love to see the final results!
