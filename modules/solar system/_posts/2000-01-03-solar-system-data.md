<h2>How big is our Solar System?</h2>

<p>Planets are big, and the distances between them are vast.  How do we wrap our brains around such big numbers?  One way is by scaling them down to relative sizes that are easy to imagine or even create!  If you are going to tackle building a model of the Solar System, you will need to figure out what scale you are going to use.  This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10oGYB5MGsuPZ7sewPjtRMBVzZY3DGHVCz6WCW5NAhkg/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> gives you the data you need to get started, and the following video explains how to use it.
