<h2>Phases of the Moon Experiment</h2>

<p>For this experiment, you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a flashlight, to represent the Sun</li>
  <li>a small ball on a stick, to represent the Moon</li>
  <li>a dark room </li>
  </ul>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Have a friend hold the flashlight so that it is just below your eyes (not shining into them).  If you don't have a friend available to help, you can place the flashlight on a shelf.</li>
  <li>Your head represents the Earth.  Stand so that you are facing the flashlight.  Hold the Moon on a stick with an outstretched arm at eye level.  This represents a new Moon.  How much of the lit-up part of the Moon can you see?</li>
  <li>Rotate counterclockwise (left) 45 degrees.  Observe the lit area of the Moon again.  This is a waxing crescent Moon.  Waxing means it is getting bigger each night.  The crescent is the shape that is lit up.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a first quarter Moon.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a waxing gibbous Moon.  Gibbous means a shape between a half-circle and a full circle.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a full Moon.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a waning gibbous Moon.  Waning means it is getting smaller each night.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a last quarter Moon.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees counterclockwise again.  This is a waning crescent Moon.</li>
  <li>Rotate 45 degrees one final time.  You have now completed the circle and are back to a new Moon.  Each cycle of the Moon takes 28 days.</li>
  </ol>
