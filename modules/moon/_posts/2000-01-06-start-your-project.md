## How will you honor the Moon?

What fascinates you most about the Moon?  Is it the way it looks different each night?  Its effect on tides?  Its geography and structure?  Its origins?  Or perhaps you are more interested in human exploration of the Moon, such as the rockets that took it there, the math and physics behind the flight, or the history of NASA and the people who worked there?

Depending on what most excites you, your project could take many forms.  You could create a Moon chart using your own photos or sketches.  You could correlate local tides with the lunar cycle.  You could create a topographic map of a section of the lunar surface.  You could build a model rocket.  You could produce your own short documentary about NASA and the space program.  Regardless of what project you choose, head on over to the [discussion board](https://discourse.treefortlearning.org/t/the-moon-project/16) to find collaborators, get feedback, and add to our amazing collection of work honoring the Moon.
