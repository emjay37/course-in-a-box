<h2>Project: Create an Astronomy-Themed Game</h2>

<p>This project is designed to synthesize things you may have explored in the other projects into one very cool astronomy-theme game.  If you wish to take on this project, we recommend that you review the content in previous projects and think about ways to combine your knowledge of astronomy with your knowledge of chance and skill in games to design your own game.  The following sections contain additional information on game theory, examples of astronomy-themed games from different genres, and some resources to get you started on creating a game in the medium of your choice.</p>

<p>Your game can be physical, like a card game or board game.  It can be digital, like a video game.  It can be virtual, like a Role-Playing Game (RPG) or Alternate Reality Game (ARG).  It can even be a sport (Martian basketball, anyone?) or outdoor activity.  We can't wait to play your game!</p>
